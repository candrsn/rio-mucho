1.0.0 (2018-07-19)
------------------

The rio-mucho packages requires rasterio~=1.0. There are no other changes since
1.0rc1.

1.0rc1 (2018-07-13)
------------------

:tada:

Support for Python versions 3.0-3.4 will be dropped in 1.0.0. These versions do
not have the fix for https://bugs.python.org/issue28699 and the multiprocessing
pool in riomucho can hang when exceptions are raised by a worker.
